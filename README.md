# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

While reviewing the Amazon Product Reviews for Major Appliances, we wanted to focus on the impact Vine Members has on the products review. We began by filtering out the data set for all appliances that had less than 20 total votes and focused on comparing the results between if there was a Vine Member who reviewed the product or not. The reason for this analysis is because Amazon Vine Members are required to publish reviews. 

## Results
### Total Number of Reviews
In total there were 35 Vine reviews and 4940 non-Vine reviews.

## Summary

In reviewing the results, there does seem to be a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine Program. By looking at the total datasets for Vine and non-Vine reviews there was a much smaller total Vine population than non-Vine population. Our Vine reviewer population has about 12% higher percentage of 5 star reviews which seems like it's more favorable than non-Vine users. This is positively skewing the Major Appliance data sets when we look at overall reviews where Vine customers purchased the product. An additional analysis we could complete would be to rerun the same above tests but now focusing on the reviews that had 2-19 total votes to see if these results hold true.
